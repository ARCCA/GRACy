GRACy is distributed under the GPL3 license. However the package embeds several third-party tools
which are installed using the Anaconda environment.The Anaconda package installer is also distributed
with the GRACy distribution.
The anaconda license is available at :

https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/eula/

The file install.sh reports all the packages that are automatically installed when GRACy is installed.
All the packages are free to use of course, but the user may want to check each single software specific
license before modifying/distributing them 

All the graphic interfaces are produced by using the Qt library (free for not commercial use, https://www.qt.io/)
